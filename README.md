# RESORT ESCAPE - FRONT-END PROJECT


üå¥ **Resort Escape Landing Page**

üìå **Overview:**

The **Resort Escape** project is a modern, fully responsive landing page designed for a luxury resort or spa. Built using core front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), the project focuses on delivering a visually captivating and user-friendly interface that effectively promotes the resort's brand, services, and contact options. It's optimized for all devices and includes smooth animations, gradient themes, and a strong visual hierarchy.


‚úÖ **Key Features:**

1. **Responsive Layout**
   Adapts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices with fluid grid and flexible elements.

2. **Linear Gradient Aesthetic**
   Uses soft **pink-purple-blue linear gradients** for a luxurious and modern look, applied to backgrounds, buttons, and text highlights.

3. **Navigation Menu with Toggle**
   Includes a mobile-responsive hamburger menu that opens and closes smoothly with JavaScript.

4. **Hero Section with Call-to-Action**
   Features a striking main heading and a prominent "Book Now" button to immediately engage visitors.

5. **Service Cards**
   Neatly displayed cards that showcase resort amenities (spa, pool, dining, etc.) with hover effects.

6. **Image Gallery**
   A sleek image section highlighting the ambience and attractions of the resort.

7. **Contact Form with Validation**
   Users can send inquiries using a contact form; submission is acknowledged via a JavaScript alert, and the form resets.

8. **Smooth Transitions & Hover Effects**
   Enhanced user interaction through CSS transitions, box shadows, and hover states.
